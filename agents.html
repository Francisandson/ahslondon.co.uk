      <div class="w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h4 class="h4">What type of contract governs our relationship?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">We provide a management agreement which has been drafted specifically for our business by a property specialist solicitor.
            <br>
            <br> Effectively, this makes Affordable Home Sharing the manager of the property for the period of the contract (typically 3-5 years) and gives us the authority to manage the property on behalf of your agency.
            <br>
            <br> This contract will be legally possible only if the agent’s agreement you have entered with the owner/landlord allows your agency to delegate all or some of your duties.
            <br>
            <br> If not, our property specialist solicitor can advise on the matter and help us to find the right solution in line with the current law.
            <br><span class="text-span-underline"><br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong>Solicitor costs will be totally covered by us.</strong></span>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h4 class="h4">Once I’ve signed a contract with Affordable Home Sharing, do I have to wait for you to find tenants before you start paying me rent?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">No. We pay the rent whether or not the property is occupied. Of course we anticipate being able to find tenants quickly, but you receive full rent from us month in and month out, regardless of the property’s’ occupancy.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h4 class="h4">What happens if Affordable Home Sharing goes under during the contract period?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">We hope this is hypothetical, but it’s an extremely fair question.
            <br>
            <br> The answer is: according to the contract we have with you, if we go out of business, the agreement ends immediately, the rent the tenants in your property have been paying and their deposit will revert to you directly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6"></div>

      <h6 class="_1 h6-faq">Mortgage Aspects</h6>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <h4 class="h4">Will there be an issue with my mortgage provider in signing a management agreement?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">As we have no security of tenure, there should not be an issue here.
        <br>
        <br> Still, we recommend that you seek authorization from your lender before entering into any contract, just to be sure. We have specific documentation that you can give to your lender along with our contract that will appease any concerns they may have.</p>

          <h4 class="h4">So you pay the rent directly to my account?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">Yes. Contractually we pay the rent. The money goes directly from our bank account to yours. We generally prefer to pay on the fifth of each month unless you specifically ask otherwise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h4 class="h4">What are the charges associated with your service?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">We charge nothing for the service we provide. We make our money on the differential between the rent we pay you and rent we collect from tenants. We charge our tenants a slight premium for providing high-spec rooms that are inclusive of utility bills and have weekly cleaners. (Though some maintenance expenses are passed through; <a href="#Property-management" class="link">see below</a>).</p>

          <h4 class="h4">What if one of the residents stop paying, or pays late?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">That does not make any difference to the rent we pay you. When a tenant pays rent late or fails to pay then that is our problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h4 class="h4">What about legal fees if someone needs to be evicted?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">It has never happen in the past years of our business as we choose our tenants very carefully. However, contractually we are responsible to cover all the legal costs related to evictions.</p>

          <h4 class="h4">Once I’ve signed a contract with Affordable Home Sharing, do I have to wait for you to find tenants before you start paying me rent?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">No. Contractually we pay you rent whether or not the property is occupied. Of course we anticipate being able to find tenants quickly, but you receive full rent from us month in and month out, regardless of the property’s occupancy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h4 class="h4">And what if the property market falls? Will you try and renegotiate our rent?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">No. Whatever we agree at the start of our tenancy we will honour for the duration of our contract. From your and the landlords perspective, of course, that is one of the virtues of a long-term contract.</p>
          <h4 class="h4">Do you pay a security deposit?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">Yes, we do pay a security deposit and we also take a deposit from every tenant.</p>

      <h4 class="h4">What about property inspections? How can I be sure that everything is always in order?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">We conduct formal inspections every 3 months and send photos directly to your inbox.
        <br>
        <br> However, our cleaners keep us informed of the state of the property on a weekly basis and if they voice any concerns we follow up immediately. And of course Affordable Home Sharing’ staff carry out informal inspections every time they visit a property, whether it is for a viewing or to check a gas meter.
        <br>
        <br> If you wish, we can arrange for you to periodically inspect the property yourself to make sure you are happy with the way we are managing things.</p>

          <h4 class="h4">How is property maintenance handled?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">The landlord will be responsible financially for the usual things a landlord is responsible for.
            <br>
            <br> However, as the manager of the property, if you wish we’ll do most of the legwork. For basic wear and tear and upkeep, we have a full-time maintenance man, and if something needs doing he does it. We will always provide you with a quote prior to carrying out any work and we will arrange access so you do not have to get involved. Routine and anticipated things like gas safety certificates shall be organized by us; we’ll handle the logistics, and pass through the expense.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h4 class="h4">What if residents cause damage?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">If something happens at the property that is deemed to be the fault of our tenants (e.g., a broken window) then we will cover the cost ourselves. If we believe the problem is beyond the scope of our responsibility (e.g., the boiler breaks down), we will call you and let you know the problem and propose options for solving it.</p>
          <h4 class="h4">How much wear and tear can I expect?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">Usually the properties we manage tends to be in better condition than it would have been had it been let by an estate agent. This is due to our regular maintenance regime (including weekly cleans) as well as the upgrades we make to the property at the time we take over its management (e.g., painting, the replacement of furnishings etc.)</p>

          <h4 class="h4">How do you find and evaluate potential tenants?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">For over a number of years we have built relationships with well- known companies who approach us to find accommodation for their staff.
            <br> We advertise via our website, and online but most of all we receive referrals via previous and current tenants.
            <br>
            <br> We also conduct thorough reference checks which include;
            <br>
            <br> • Previous landlord reference
            <br> • Proof of employment (including their employment contract or pay slips)
            <br> • Sight their passport in the office (in line with right to rent regulations)
            <br> • Visa check (if applicable)
            <br> • Proof of address via bank statement or utility bill
            <br>
            <br>Though we consider references from previous landlords and employers very important, we feel that gut instinct is even more vital. Someone can have impeccable references however if we do not feel they are suitable we will not accept them
            <br>
            <br>In 5 years of business we have never had a “bad” tenant!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h4 class="h4">Aren't most of your tenants just irresponsible students?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">No, our tenants are professionals usually in their mid-20s 30s and 40s.</p>
          <h4 class="h4">What if someone moves out?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">It is completely our responsibility to keep properties occupied.&nbsp;Whether full or vacant we still pay the full rent on time every month.</p>
          <h4 class="h4">What if a resident locks himself out or loses her keys?</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">That will not be anything you will ever have to deal with while we manage your property.
            <br>
            <br> Tenants will call us if they are locked out or lose their keys and we will organise replacements and cover the costs. Again, this is a primary benefit of having Affordable Home Sharing as your property manager rather than having to deal with the property yourself day to day.</p>

        <br>Affordable Home Sharing is a property manager. We sign a fixed term agreement with you (usually 3-5 years) to take charge of your property.
        <br>
        <br> • During that time, we pay you a guaranteed rent, every month, regardless of the property’s’ occupancy.
        <br>• We organise the maintenance of your property.
        <br>• Finding and checking references of our corporate and professional tenants, keeping them happy in their homes, and collecting their rent, becomes Affordable Home Sharing’s responsibility.</p>
